# Xray reporter for Playwright

Publish Playwright test run on Xray

This reporter is based in playwright zephyr from Yevhen Laichenkov https://github.com/elaichenkov/playwright-zephyr
Thanks Yevhen for the great contribution

## Install

```sh
npm i -D playwright-xray
```

## Usage

Add reporter to your `playwright.config.ts` configuration file

### Cloud version

Authenticate with `client_id` and `client_secret` key.

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [
    [
      'playwright-xray',
      {
        jira: {
          url: 'https://your-jira-url',
          type: 'cloud',
          apiVersion: '1.0',
        },
        cloud: {
          client_id: '',
          client_secret: '',
        },
        projectKey: 'JIRA_CODE',
        testPlan: 'JIRA_CODEXXXXX',
        debug: false,
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

### Server version

Authenticate with `token` key.

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [
    [
      'playwright-xray',
      {
        jira: {
          url: 'https://your-jira-url',
          type: 'server',
          apiVersion: '1.0',
        },
        server: {
          token: 'YOUR_SERVER_TOKEN',
        },
        projectKey: 'JIRA_CODE',
        testPlan: 'JIRA_CODEXXXXX',
        debug: false,
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

Also, your playwright tests should include unique ID `J79` of your Xray test case + `|`:

```typescript
// Xray test case ID + |
test('J79 | basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  const title = page.locator('.navbar__inner .navbar__title');
  await expect(title).toHaveText('Playwright');
});
```

### Optional config

Is it possible to add some optional values to the Test Execution ticket.

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [
    [
      'playwright-xray',
      {
        jira: {
          url: 'https://your-jira-url',
          type: 'server',
          apiVersion: '1.0',
        },
        cloud: {
          client_id: '',
          client_secret: '',
        },
        server: {
          token: '',
        },
        projectKey: 'JIRA_CODE',
        testPlan: 'JIRA_CODE-XXX',
        debug: false,
        // Optional
        testExecution: 'JIRA_CODE-YYY',
        version: 'v1.0',
        revision: '12345',
        description: 'This test was executed automatically',
        testEnvironments: ['dev', 'test'],
        uploadScreenShot: true,
        uploadTrace: true,
        uploadVideo: true,
        markFlakyWith: "FLAKY",
        stepCategories: ['test.step'],
        summary: `[${new Date().toLocaleString('fr-FR', { timeZone: 'Europe/Paris' })}] - Automated`
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

### Proxy

If you use a proxy to access Jira, you need to configure the proxy. This proxy information will be used by Axios to send the results to Jira.

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [
    [
      'playwright-xray',
      {
        jira: {
          url: 'https://your-jira-url',
          type: 'server',
          apiVersion: '1.0',
        },
        cloud: {
          client_id: '',
          client_secret: '',
        },
        server: {
          token: '',
        },
        projectKey: 'JIRA_CODE',
        testPlan: 'JIRA_CODE-XXX',
        debug: false,
        // Optional
        proxy: {
          protocol: 'http',
          host: '0.0.0.0',
          port: 80,
          auth: {
            username: 'USER',
            password: 'p@$$w0Rd',
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

> If your proxy server doesn't need authentication, just omit the `auth` part.
>
> If no proxy is configured, Axios is forced to doesn't use proxy.

### Execution

Then run your tests with `npx playwright test` command and you'll see the result in console:

```sh
-------------------------------------

⏺  Starting the run with 6 tests

✅ Chrome | XRAYISSUE-2 | another test
✅ Chrome | XRAYISSUE-1 | basic test
✅ Firefox | XRAYISSUE-1 | basic test
⛔ Chrome | XRAYISSUE-3 | another test
⛔ Firefox | XRAYISSUE-2 | another test
⛔ Firefox | XRAYISSUE-3 | another test

-------------------------------------

## Multiple Test Plans

If you need to send report for more than one test plan, you need to create a config file for each test plan.
Create a folder (e.g. configs) in your project and for each test plan, create a new playwright config file in this folder.

```ts
// configs/TCK-87.config.ts

import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import base from '../playwright.config';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  ...base,
  testDir: '../tests',
  use: {
    ...base.use,
    headless: true,
  },
  reporter: [
    [
      'playwright-xray',
      {
        jira: {
          url: 'https://your-jira-url',
          type: 'server',
          apiVersion: '1.0',
        },
        server: {
          token: 'YOUR_SERVER_TOKEN',
        },
        projectKey: 'TCK',
        testPlan: 'TCK-87',
      },
    ],
  ],
};
export default config;
```

Now you can choose which config file you want to use executing the tests, using the command below:

```
npx playwright test --config=configs/TCK-87.config.ts
```

If no config file is chosen, the default config file "playwright.config.ts" will be used.

## Notes

- To have the steps imported you have to create them in the test issue itself.
  The steps will be imported by order of execution and inserted into the test.

- Xray only permits an upload size of maximum 100 MiB and subsequently playwright-xray will fail to upload the 
  execution result due to the total size of videos and traces exceeds this limit. In order to still be able to 
  update the Xray execution status while still being able to view the videos and traces in e.g. Jenkins the 
  switches below can be used to exclude evidence from the Xray import file.

- Test that will pass after a rerun will be tagged with whatever is defined with the option "markFlakyWith"
  If this option is not set, the test will be tagged as PASSED. Please note that you have to define the
  Execution Status you choose in Xray, e.g. FLAKY.

- Stepcategories defines how playwright-xray reporter should recognize test steps. The built-in categories in Playwright are the following:

* `hook` for fixtures and hooks initialization and teardown
* `expect` for expect calls
* `pw:api` for Playwright API calls.
* `test.step` for test.step API calls.

If the option `stepCategories` is not set, playwright-xray will default to `['expect', 'pw:api', 'test.step']` If e.g. only `['test.step']`
is defined, playwright-xray will only record code defined with `test.step('This is a test step', async () => { .... });` as a test step.

- The test execution summary defaults to `[${new Date().toUTCString()}] - Automated run` but this can be overidden by the
  config file option `summary:`

```ts
[
      'playwright-xray',
      {
        jira: {
          url: 'https://your-jira-url',
          type: 'server',
          apiVersion: '1.0',
        },
        server: {
          token: 'YOUR_SERVER_TOKEN',
        },
        projectKey: 'TCK',
        testPlan: 'TCK-87',
        uploadScreenShot: false,
        uploadTrace: false,
        uploadVideo: false,
        markFlakyWith: "FLAKY",
        stepCategories: ['test.step'],
        summary: `[${new Date().toLocaleString('fr-FR', { timeZone: 'Europe/Paris' })}] - Automated`
      },
    ],
```
- Please ensure that you correctly type the e.g. testKey in the test or you might encounter {"error":"Invalid JQL query"}
  respnse, e.g. if you type TES- 49 instead of TES-49.
